        <p>The binary system is how we convert electricity into information.</p>
        <p>A bit - the smallest piece of information - is based on one binary choice, 0 or 1.</p>
        <p>We can use binary code to represent numbers - which means we can use it to represent text, sound, and video.</p>
        <p>A circuit will take a binary input and flip it - a '0' becomes a '1' and vice versa.</p>
        <p>A complicated circuit is where logic gates come in.</p>  
        <p><em>For instance:</em></p>
        <p>One type of complicated circuit will only give 1 if the first signal and the second signal are both 1.</p>
        <p>This is the logic of an 'and' circuit.</p>  
        <p>There are many small circuits like this that perform simple logical calculations.
        </p>
        <p>The microscopic circuits found in today's computers can perform calculatina like this extremely quickly.</p>

        <p> An <em>input</em> device turns input (like typing, voice or pictures) into binary information. Then a <em>storage</em> device stores it.</p>
        <p>A CPU process the information, and an output device - like a speaker or a computer screen - will send the user that information in a way we can digest.</p>
